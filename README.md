# JeshuJunaGo!

This is a simple web search engine that makes use of Azure Bing Services and Azure API Management. It has been live coded on my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soy_jeshu) channel and you can watch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLS-IeTV50b7yBYytRcsi2Q/) as well.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
